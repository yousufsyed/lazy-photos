# lazy-photos

This is a sample app to demo the following:

### Native Lazy image loading: 

* Fetch photos from the network, 
* DecodeBitmap from the response,
* process the bitmap,
* save to disk,
* cache results in memory using Lru cache,
* and finally lazily load the bitmap into Image.

### Back Navigation
The app also handles navigation from
  * list of photos to the details view and
  * back navigation from the details screen to the list screen.

### MVVM architecture pattern

### Jetpack Compose
